As the American Health Care Act heads to the Senate, many Americans are worried about their premiums rising as a result of preexisting conditions.

Data journalist [Carl V. Lewis](https://data.world/carlvlewis?utm_source=autopilot&utm_medium=email&utm_content=170511&utm_campaign=localization_campaign_illinois) created a dataset to localize the data by state and congressional district.

In this [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mallaham/Affordable-Healthcare-Act-by-State-and-Age-group/blob/master/healthcare%20repeal.ipynb), I attempt to provide (what I'm hoping) some useful visulizations on who
will be affected by the repeal of the Affordable Healthcare Act.
